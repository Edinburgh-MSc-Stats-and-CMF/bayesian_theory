\chapter{Foundational Algebra and Analysis}

I want you to restart from scratch - I want to change the way you imagine \textit{Mathematics}. I want you to visualise most of its concepts and appreciate its beauty. \\

Let's start with the most basic question possible - \textit{What is mathematics?} In my opinion, mathematics is the study of abstractions. The first and foremost abstract idea is the \textit{number}. Numbers are the direct consequence of our ability to count. When I mention 3 or 6, you understand the quantity without considering what is being counted; the focus is on the act of counting, making the number itself an abstract entity. Despite it being such an abstract entity, we have been able to  work with it and have developed theories of mathematics around it - from algebra to calculus, from analysis to probability theory and what not. \\

But knowing numbers isn't enough. We have to extend this idea of abstractions before we dive deep into the probability theory.
