\chapter{Classical Probability}\cite{joeblitztein}

Whatever we learnt in the previous chapter, will be useful in the next chapter. In this chapter, I want to recap all the basic concepts of probability we have studied previously and at the end demonstrate - why we need a better, a more rigorous framework, for the probability theory. \\

Just as a point is not defined in elementary geometry, probability theory begins with two entities that are not defined. These undefined entities are a \textit{Random Experiment} and its \textit{Outcome}. These two concepts are to be understood intuitively, as suggested by their respective English meanings. We use these undefined terms to define other entities. \\

So, let's begin!
